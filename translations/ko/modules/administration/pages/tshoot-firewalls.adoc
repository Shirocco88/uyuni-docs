= Troubleshooting Firewalls


If you are using a firewall that blocks outgoing traffic, it can either ``REJECT`` or ``DROP`` network requests. If it is set to ``DROP`` then you might find that synchronizing with the {scc} times out.

This occurs because the synchronization process needs to access third-party repositories that provide packages for non-{suse} clients, and not just the {scc}. When the {productname} Server attempts to reach these repositories to check that they are valid, the firewall drops the requests, and the synchronization continues to wait for the response until it times out.

If this occurs, the synchronization takes a long time before it fails, and your non-{suse} products are not shown in the product list.

You can fix this problem in several different ways.

The simplest method is to configure your firewall to allow access to the URLs required by non-{suse} repositories. This allows the synchronization process to reach the URLs and complete successfully.

If allowing external traffic is not possible, configure your firewall to ``REJECT`` requests from {productname} instead of ``DROP``. This rejects requests to third-party URLs, so that the synchronization fails early rather than times out, and the products are not shown in the list.

If you do not have configuration access to the firewall, you can consider setting up a separate firewall on the {productname} Server instead.
