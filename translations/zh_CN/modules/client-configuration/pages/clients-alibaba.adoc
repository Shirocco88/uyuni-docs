== 创建激活密钥

You need to create an activation key that is associated with your {alibabaclo} channels.

有关激活密钥的详细信息，请参见 xref:client-configuration: activation-keys.adoc[]。



== 注册客户端

{alibabaclo} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.

Some {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 instances will fail to register on the first try.

This is due to a to a known bug in the {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 image.

The `python-urlgrabber3` package is provided both as a Python pip package and an RPM package, which can cause a conflict on the first attempt to register.

If your instance is based on one of the affected image versions, the client should register correctly on the second registration attempt.

For more information about client registration, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
